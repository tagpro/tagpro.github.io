I am writing to express my interest in the {role} role that I found out about via {source}. I am currently pursuing Master's in Computing at The Australian National University and am in my 4th and final Semester. Given my past experience, I would like to join {company} where I deliver to the best of my calibre to produce exceptional quality work and the experience gained will help me in improving my skills.

Presently, I will be graduating in July 2019 and will move to Temporary Graduate VISA which allows me to work for 2 years after my Graduation.

In past, I have worked as a Technical Analyst at Hashedin Technologies, India for 2 years. During my contract, my role was to work as a Web Application Developer. I worked on various projects involving Python, Django, ReactJS, and many front-end libraries and frameworks. As a developer, I have attained proficiency working with git as well. I did an internship at Aristotle Metadata registry as a Python/Django developer for 3 months in July 2018. I have also worked at CSIRO from December 2017 to March 2019 on a couple of projects where I have worked on multiple technologies mainly working on EmberJS, ExpressJS and ReactJS.

In future, I would like to work on projects which provide a continuous learning experience and I, in turn, use my skills to build some awesome products.

I appreciate that you took the time to read this application. I hope I get to work at {company} and learn a lot.

Best Regards,
Jaspreet Singh | +61 450 327 168
